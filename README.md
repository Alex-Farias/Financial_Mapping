# Deployment Instructions for Fixed Bank Analysis Application

I've created updated versions of all your backend service main.go files to fix the issues preventing your application from working correctly. Here's how to implement and deploy these changes:

## 1. Update the Backend Service Files

Replace the content of each service's main.go file with the corrected versions provided:

1. **API Gateway**: Replace `bank-analysis/api-gateway/main.go` content
2. **Auth Service**: Replace `bank-analysis/auth-service/main.go` content
3. **Import Service**: Replace `bank-analysis/import-service/main.go` content
4. **Analysis Service**: Replace `bank-analysis/analysis-service/main.go` content (combine both parts)
5. **Export Service**: Replace `bank-analysis/export-service/main.go` content and add the missing import

## 2. Key Fixes Applied

### API Gateway
- Proper route prefix stripping when forwarding requests to microservices
- Enhanced logging to track request forwarding
- Improved authentication token handling

### Import Service
- Fixed MongoDB index creation to use `bson.D` instead of `bson.M`
- Added support for Nubank CSV format
- Implemented upsert for transactions to avoid duplicate key errors
- Added detailed logging

### Analysis Service
- Fixed pipeline aggregation syntax using `bson.D` with Key/Value pairs
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed the route paths to work with the API gateway

### Export Service
- Added proper error handling
- Added a debug endpoint for viewing transactions

### Auth Service
- Fixed token validation
- Added proper email extraction from JWT claims

## 3. Rebuild and Deploy

Once you've updated all the files, follow these steps to rebuild and deploy:

```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Rebuild services
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up
```

## 4. Testing Your Fixed Application

1. **Check Service Status**:
   - Each service now has a `/ping` endpoint to verify it's working

2. **Test the Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Register a user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

3. **Test Importing a CSV**:
   - Log in via the frontend
   - Try uploading a Nubank CSV file on the Import page

4. **Check the Dashboard and Transactions**:
   - After importing data, navigate to the Dashboard
   - Check if transactions are visible in the Transactions view

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check the Logs**:
   ```bash
   # View logs for a specific service
   docker logs bank-analysis-import
   docker logs bank-analysis-analysis
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Get a token first from login
   TOKEN="your_token_here"
   
   # Test ping endpoint
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/analysis/ping
   
   # Test monthly endpoint
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/analysis/monthly
   
   # View transactions (debug endpoint)
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/export/debug/transactions
   ```

3. **Check MongoDB Data**:
   ```bash
   # Connect to MongoDB container
   docker exec -it bank-analysis-mongodb mongosh
   
   # View transactions
   use bank_analysis
   db.transactions.find()
   ```

The main issues with your application have been fixed, particularly:
1. The import service error with `bson.D` vs `bson.M`
2. The path handling in the API gateway
3. The support for Nubank CSV format
4. The aggregation pipeline for monthly analysis

If you need further assistance after implementing these changes, please provide any new error messages or issues you encounter.
